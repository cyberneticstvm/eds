                <p>A good teacher knows how to bring out the best in you. Effective teachers know not only how to prepare you for a particular job but they set you on a path to continuous learning throughout your life. An ordinary teacher would only be able to give you a nice job, but a good teacher would give you the abilities to keep that job and progress in your career throughout your professional life.</p>
                <p>Effective teachers know how to fill you with passion for the subject, how theoretical knowledge applies to real-life scenarios, and how students can progress in their career amidst fast-evolving technologies and ever-growing competition. Every single lesson becomes a memorable one when you study with a good teacher. An ordinary teacher would build you a castle of knowledge in sand. But, a real great teacher would leave you with knowledge etched in rock. So, choose wisely!</p>

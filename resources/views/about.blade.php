            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
                    <p class="dropcaps">Hello students, I am Daniel AG, founder of Empire Data Systems LLC. I started my career as an SQL Server programmer way back in 1996 and I worked my way up in database domain. Today, I am working as Data Architect for a financial firm near Philadelphia, USA.</p>
                    <p>I have attended numerous training programs as part of my professional career. Most of the programs turned out to be below my expectations. In most cases, trainers did not have real-time experiences and they were not able to answer or understand questions based on real-time scenarios. Those subjective experiences led me to recognize the need for training programs conducted by IT professionals who have real-world experience and have a passion for teaching. That is why I started my own database training programs.</p>
                    <p>As a part-time trainer, I am guided by my passion for teaching and willingness to help students even after the training. My philosophy embedded into my program is that theory is important, but real-time scenarios and hands-on coding are essential to gaining skills needed to work successfully in the IT world. I do not believe in gimmicks as you will not see fancy slide-shows and false promises like “100% placement assistance”. I am about providing you with the best learning opportunity possible so that you can be in the best position to attain your career goals. Teaching is an art which I do well.</p>
                    <p>Majority of my students are working IT professionals who want to enhance their technical skills, or professionals looking forward to a change in career. Some students want to begin a career in information technology. My “study together” teaching mythology is so effective that people without any IT background could follow it. My training program is supported by excellent course material, hands-on lab exercise and research papers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
                    <p>My online training programs are live, interactive, instructor-led programs. After each class, you will get recorded video of the live training session and you could keep it forever and review it later. This makes the online training more effective and attractive than classroom training. In classroom training, after the session, you are by yourself. How long you can remember things learned in classroom training? To be honest with you, classroom trainings are a thing of the past.</p>
                    <p>As you might have noticed, I offer training programs only in high-end technologies like databases and business intelligence. Learning these technologies makes sure that you get a better pay than your .NET/JAVA/TESTING/QA friends, and makes sure that your voice is well heard in team meetings. After all, we all work for eight hours a day, so why would you want to settle for less?</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, all my courses are in-depth and comprehensive courses. No wonder 70% of my students are referral students. Attending watered-down courses not only wastes your money but also your precious time and effort. Please check our course content and you will be surprised the in-depth coverage on each topic.</p>
                    <p>One key element to a successful IT career is how early you get trained in latest technologies. The more you wait, the higher the competition you are going to address. After all, your career is all about what you know and how well you market it.</p>
